# Use the widgets beneath and the content will be
# inserted automagically in the webpage. To make
# this work, you have to use › layout: frontpage
#
layout: page-fullwidth
header:
  image_fullwidth: header3.jpg

#
# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss

permalink: /index.html

# This is a nasty hack to make the navigation highlight
# this page as active in the topbar navigation

RuMorS, (RUntime MOnitoRing for Software-intensive systems) aims to aid engineers in 
1. <b>Discovering, analyzing, and selecting relevant information</b> about the system’s behavior<br> such as functional requirements or safety-related behavior.
2. <b>Creating monitors</b> in order to observe and ensure the correct behavior of the system and interplay among hardware, software, and human actors.
3. <b>Describing expected human behavior</b> and monitoring this behavior at runtime to ensure that the system adheres to its (often safety-critical) prescriptions.
