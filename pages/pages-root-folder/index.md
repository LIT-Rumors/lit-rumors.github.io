# Use the widgets beneath and the content will be
# inserted automagically in the webpage. To make
# this work, you have to use › layout: frontpage
#
layout: page-fullwidth
header:
  image_fullwidth: header2.jpg

#
# Use the call for action to show a button on the frontpage
#
# To make internal links, just use a permalink like this
# url: /getting-started/
#
# To style the button in different colors, use no value
# to use the main color or success, alert or secondary.
# To change colors see sass/_01_settings_colors.scss
#
permalink: /index.html
#
# This is a nasty hack to make the navigation highlight
# this page as active in the topbar navigation

RuMorS, (RUntime MOnitoRing for Software-intensive systems) aims to aid engineers in (i) discovering, analyzing, and selecting relevant information about the system’s behavior (such as functional requirements or safety-related behavior), (ii) creating monitors in order to observe and ensure the correct behavior of the system and interplay among hardware, software, and human actors, and finally, (iii) means for describing expected human behavior and monitoring this behavior at runtime to ensure that the system adheres to its (often safety-critical) prescriptions.
