## RuMorS - Runtime Monitoring for Software-Intensive Systems



The domain of software-intensive systems in general and cyber-physical systems (CPS) in particular has drawn
considerable attention from both industry and academia. With the steady growth of CPS, smart ecosystems,
and the Internet of Things, software-intensive systems are becoming pervasive in everyone’s daily life. Examples
range from unmanned autonomous vehicles, smart cities, unmanned aerial vehicles used for delivery or disaster
management to name but a few. Furthermore, industry is increasingly adopting cyber-physical production systems
(CPPS) and shop floor automation.


Regardless of the domain in which the systems are deployed, what they share and have in common is a shift
from traditional software systems and software engineering principles towards pervasive systems where software,
hardware, and human actors controlling them are deeply interwoven and dependent upon each other. This not
only affects the way software is used but also impacts the way CPS are designed, developed, maintained, and
evolved. Not only must the software deliver its required functionality but it must do so in a way that ensures that
the system is safe and secure for its intended use.
Due to the interplay of a vast number of different components with hardware, software, and human actors, op-
erating these systems the intended way and ensuring their safe behavior at runtime is a non-trivial and challenging
task.


RuMorS, (RUntime MOnitoRing for Software-intensive systems)  is designed to aid
engineers in (i) discovering, analyzing, and selecting relevant information about the system’s behavior (such as
functional requirements or safety-related behavior), (ii) creating monitors in order to observe and ensure the
correct behavior of the system and interplay among hardware, software, and human actors, and finally, (iii) means
for describing expected human behavior and monitoring this behavior at runtime to ensure that the system adheres
to its (often safety-critical) prescriptions.
